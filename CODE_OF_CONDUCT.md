# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, or nationality. We value respectful and considerate interactions, and we expect all participants to uphold these standards in all community activities and communications.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

**Enforcement Guidelines:**

1. **Initial Response:** A member of the project team will reach out to the complainant and the accused party to discuss the details of the issue.
2. **Investigation:** A thorough investigation will be conducted to gather all relevant information.
3. **Resolution:** Depending on the severity of the behavior, appropriate action will be taken, ranging from a warning to temporary or permanent ban from the project.
